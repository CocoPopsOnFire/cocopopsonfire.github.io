<h2>Welcome to my Dev blog!</h2>

This is where I'll be documenting my future projects and any ideas I have about gaming and programming in General

Things I would like to achieve with this blog:

1. Help others that might be encountering similar challenges as myself
2. Document changes to projects that are interesting
3. Remember what I have done just in case I break everything


<h3>A little bit about me</h3>

I graduated university several years ago with a bachelors in electronics and computing. Ever since I have been chasing the dream of working with electronics and software.

Starting with C in university I moved to web development upon graduating but found it lacked the impact that I enjoyed while studying. Since then i have taken a couple of courses on C# and also intend to try C++
